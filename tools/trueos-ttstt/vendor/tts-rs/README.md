# tts-rs

A Rust library for text-to-speech synthesis using the [Kokoro](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) neural TTS model via ONNX inference.

## Features

- **Kokoro TTS engine** — natural-sounding neural speech via ONNX Runtime
- **Multiple voices** — 26 voices across 9 languages (English US & UK, Spanish, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese Brazilian, Chinese Mandarin)
- **Chunked synthesis callback** — for text above 510 phonemes, one completed
  model chunk can be consumed while the next is synthesized
- **CPU-only** — no GPU required; runs efficiently on any modern CPU
- **Three precision levels** — f32, f16, and int8 model variants

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
tts-rs = { version = "2026.2.3", features = ["kokoro"] }
```

### Available Features

| Feature | Description | Dependencies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `kokoro` | Kokoro neural TTS (ONNX) | `ort`, `ndarray`, `zip` |

No features are enabled by default. You must opt in explicitly.

## Model Files

Download the following files from the [taylorchu/kokoro-onnx v0.2.0 release](https://github.com/taylorchu/kokoro-onnx/releases/tag/v0.2.0):

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `kokoro-v1.0.onnx` | 310 MB | Full precision (f32) |
| `kokoro-v1.0.fp16.onnx` | 169 MB | Half precision (f16) |
| `kokoro-v1.0.int8.onnx` | 88 MB | Quantized (int8) — recommended |
| `voices-v1.0.bin` | — | Style vectors for all 26 voices (required) |

The `voices-v1.0.bin` file is required regardless of which model variant you use. Place all downloaded files in the same directory and pass that path to `load_model`.

## Usage

```rust
use tts_rs::{
    SynthesisEngine,
    engines::kokoro::{KokoroEngine, KokoroInferenceParams},
};
use std::path::PathBuf;

let mut engine = KokoroEngine::new();
engine.load_model(&PathBuf::from("models/kokoro"))?;

let audio = engine.synthesize(
    "Hello, world!",
    Some(KokoroInferenceParams::default()),
)?;
// audio.samples contains f32 PCM at audio.sample_rate (24 kHz for Kokoro)
```

`KokoroEngine::synthesize_streaming` invokes a callback with owned,
crossfaded `SynthesisResult` chunks. A short input still requires one complete,
blocking ONNX inference before its first samples exist; progressive output is
available when Kokoro splits longer input across multiple model calls.

## Running the Example

```sh
cargo run --example kokoro --features kokoro
```

## Acknowledgements

This library is derived from [transcribe-rs](https://github.com/cjpais/transcribe-rs) by
[CJ Pais](https://github.com/cjpais), which was itself built as the inference backend for the
[Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/handy) project. The original library supported multiple
speech-to-text (ASR) engines; this fork removes those entirely and repurposes the codebase
to focus exclusively on Kokoro TTS synthesis.
